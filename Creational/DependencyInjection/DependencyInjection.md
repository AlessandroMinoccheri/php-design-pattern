# Dependency Injection

Dependency injection is a design pattern which helps to reduce tight coupling because you inject into a class its collaborators.
It's when components are provided with dependencies through their constructors, methods, or directly in fields.

## When to use It

You need to use Dependency injection pattern when you want to create application with reusable, testable and decoupled code.
Many PHP frameworks (Symfony, Drupal 8) has instantiated in their core a dependency injection container to use immediately the dependency injection pattern.
